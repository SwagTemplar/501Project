<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p>There are many reasons why a fully autonomous vehicle is beneficial for a variety of different reasons. Litman (2017) states that it can reduce the stress and boredom the driver may feel when driving. The time spent driving can now be used to be
    productive much like a mobile office or it can be used to have a rest between your destinations unltimately reducing time unit travel costs. Autonoumous vehicles can also be the solution those who cannot drive themselves places,
    whether they are physically prevented, or mentally unstable to drive. Litman also mentions that the burden of chaffeuring your family members places can free up a significant amount of time, increasing productivity. </p>

<p>Fagnant and Kockelman (2015) mentions the inherent difference between fully autonomous driving and human-driven vehicles. Autonomous vehicles can be programmed not to break traffic laws, a machine can not become drunk on alcohol.
    Machines have faster reaction times meaning less idle behavior between red lights. From this is can be infered that autonomous vehicles can drastically reduce the human errors that can happen while driving. From the 
    statistics given from the New Zealand Ministry of Transport (2019) approximately 45% of the driver deaths were due to alcohol and drugs, another 10% due to driver fatigue, and just under 5% due to drivers becoming distracted.
    These statistics only involve crashes that cause death, and also suggest that should autonomous driving be safely implemented it will decrease the fatal crashes that happen in New Zealand by atleast 60% </p>

<p>
    Fagnant and Kockelman (2015) also states that fully autonomous vehicles can help with congestion and fuel efficiency. The AI can sense and predict the acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle infront of the car and accelerate accordingly
    to be the most fuel efficient. Braking to slow down can be done smoothly and can help combat congestion due to the cascading effects of a driver having to react to the flow of traffic.
