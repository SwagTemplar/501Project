    <h1><em>Opportunities of Autonomous Vehicles</em></h1>

    <p>
        Autonomous vehicles (AVs), much like other up and coming technology, is pioneered for the obvious benefits they will have. Since the technology has not been 
        fully realised, most the alleged benefits will be theorectical, but given enough logical thinking, these opportunities are not that far fetched. 
        This webpage will discuss the opportunities to this technology and the potential that they have. Such topics include the increase of productivity, increase of road safety, and fuel efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
        Transportation can be a massive time sink. Given the AV's nature, should the technology come into fruition, Transportation time can now be converted into time where people can rest or become productive.
        Litman (2017) states that the time spent driving can now be used productively and cars can now serve as a mobile office or a mobile bedroom. AV transportation will thus reduce the time unit travel cost
        otherwise known as the cost of travel time (the cost of the time spent on transport) as transport no longer hampers an individual's ability to work. Productivity will also increase for those who 
        have dependents such as children, the physically unable, or the mentally unstable. AVs can become a perfect solution to those who cannot drive themselves. This will increase productivity
        as the people who would be chaffeuring them can free up a significant amount of time. AVs can help relieve people of the burden of being a chaffeur.
    </p>

    <p>
        Human error when driving contributes significantly to the number of deaths on the road. From the statistics given from the New Zealand Ministry of Transport (2019)
        approximately 45% of the driver deaths were due to alcohol and drugs, another 10% due to driver fatigue, and just under 5% due to drivers becoming distracted.
        Fagnant and Kockelman (2015) states that the inherent difference between AVs and human-driven vehicle is that AVs can reduce human errors. 
        A machine does not possess the flaws that a human would have, such as fatigue, and AVs can be programmed to not break traffic laws. 
        Should AVs be safely implemented in New Zealand, given the statistics above, it will decrease the fatal crashes that happen by atleast 60% as majority of crashes that cause death are due to 
        human errors/decision making.
    </p>

    <p>
        AVs also present an argument for increased fuel efficiency. AI can calculate the most optimal speed and acceleration given the following surroundings and environment thus being extremely fuel
        efficient. Machines also have faster reaction times compared to humans which means less idle behavior between stops or red lights (Fagnant and Kockelman 2015). 
        These factors can also help combat congestions as it will reduce the cascading effects of a driver having to react to the flow of traffic. This is supported by John (2018) mentioning that
        within high density traffic, a small interference can become amplified to become a full blown traffic jam.
