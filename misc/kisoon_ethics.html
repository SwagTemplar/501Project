<h1>Kisoon Ethical Reflection</h1>


<p>
    Given that autonomous vehicles are entrusted with the lives of their patrons, it is understandable that there will be ethical concerns regarding how the AI will behave in 
    a situation where it must weigh the lives of human beings. The current state of AVs is not yet acceptable for consumers to use, but regardless of the current state of the technology, 
    it is undeniable that the potential possessed by self-driving cars are enormous. In a society where transportation is such a large factor, the significance of AVs is certainly not small.
</p>
<p>
    However, to appease the ethical concerns of the those who think critically of AVs, it is paramount to continue the development of AVs as transparent as possible. 
    Personally, I do not think much of the ethical concerns of how the AI will behave. Artificial intelligence by nature will have to act accordingly to preset algorithms and if these
    algorithms are made known publicly, then I think there will be no problems. However, the laws with which the AI will abide by must be structured clearly and robustly as to account for all the 
    situations there could be. Should autonomous vehicles become mainstream, then I believe society will adapt regardless of the ethical concerns that exists. Like most technology, the ethical concerns
    are usually forgotten with some transparency on how the technology works and most importantly, if the technology brings convenience to the user.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, I think the ethical concerns are a non-issue. I recommend that regardless of the ethical dilemmas, the research and development of autonomous vehicles should continue as I 
    firmly believe that trying to make machines understand the morals and ethics of human drivers is nothing more than being idealistic. I suspect that given enough development and safety testing, 
    the total number of vehicle related accidents will decrease drastically. Even with the current road systems, if pedestrians abide by the law, then I estimate that there will be little to no issues.
