    <h1><em>Risks of Autonomous Vehicles</em></h1>

    <p>
        The act of driving can be complex, and several cognitive tasks are required. Annually, an estimated 1.25million people are killed and up to 50 million are injured when driving <cite>(Wegman, 2017)</cite>.
        There have been continuous efforts by researchers and manufacturers of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to reduce the risk of and even prevent road traffic related incidences. However, despite technology evolving to a point where vehicles can be considered autonomous, there are several other risks that are posed.
        This segment will discuss some risk factors that need to be taken into account when considering the use of AVs including creating a false sense of security,
        complex real life driving decisions that may be difficult for an algorithm to decipher given the moral complexities, as well as the opportunity for cyber attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firstly, a false sense of security that is created when declaring a vehicle autonomous can pose a considerable risk on the road.
        Many road accidents occur due to a lack of driver attention. Research has shown that this holds true for both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicle crashes <cite>(Borenstein, Herkert, & Miller, 2019)</cite>.
        Drivers are highly likely to fall into this false sense of security as there is significantly less attention and effort required when in an autonomous vehicle in comparison to a conventional vehicle.
        However, when faced with complex situations that may not be suitable for a preset algorithm to decide, it is less likely the user of an AV will be able to respond in a timely manner as they are likely to not be paying as much attention to the situation at hand in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
        The development of AVs has resulted in a technical social dilemmas, with one of them being the control algorithms.
        An example situation of this is the algorithm’s decision to collide into and harm a pedestrian versus sacrificing the AV and its passenger(s).
        For some, the morally correct choice may be to save the pedestrian, however if AVs are programmed to follow this course, it may be a deterring factor for buyers as others may believe that their own safety supersedes that of others <cite>(Bonnefon, Shariff, & Shariff, 2016)</cite>.
        There must be decisions that are made to align with the moral algorithms of what we as humans are willing to accept as we subject ourselves to the use of autonomous vehicles. As such, the more AVs that are manufactured and used by the public, there will be better opportunity to further develop moral algorithms.
    </p>

    <p>
        The digitised operating system of an AV also leaves it vulnerable to cyber security attacks. There have previously been instances where AV systems have been infiltrated and taken over by hackers and caused significant harm to the user <cite>(Lee, 2017)</cite>.
        Although cyber security continues to evolve to prevent such occurrences, we have seen evidence of hackers in general technological domains also evolving and finding different methods of obtaining non-consensual and harmful control of operating systems (e.g. banking information, confidential and classified government documents).
        As such, despite cyber security technology being ever-evolving, there may always be an element of vulnerability with AV operating systems <cite>(Taeihagh & Lim, 2019)</cite>.
    </p>
    <b><em>Risk Detection in AVs</em></b>
    <p>
        Autonomous vehicles are required to go through their own in-depth testing procedures. To minimize some of the above risks, there are a list of requirements needed prior to  getting legal permission for autonomous vehicle to access public roads.
        Nowakowski and colleagues <cite>(2015)</cite> carried out research in the USA in order to formulate road situations to which AV control systems should be able to respond to adequately. Some of the requirements included:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Detect and respond to speed limit changes</li>
        <li>Perform high and low speed merge</li>
        <li>Park on the shoulder or transition the vehicle to a minimal risk state</li>
        <li>Detect and respond to dangerous oncoming traffic</li>
        <li>Detection of permitted and restricted zones for driving on the road, and maneuvers performing in permitted areas</li>
        <li>Perform car following including ‘stop and go’ and emergency braking</li>
        <li>Detect and respond to stopped vehicles, intended lane changes, and static obstables in roadway</li>
        <li>Detection of traffic light signals, road signs of stopping and giving the way</li>
        <li>Respond to traffic light signals, road signs of stopping and giving the way</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A limitation of this study was that the requirements listed above did not have other environmental conditions that could result in infinite numbers of possibilities which means 100% safety and 0% risk of the use of an AV can not be guaranteed <cite>(Ivanov & Shadrin, 2018)</cite>.
