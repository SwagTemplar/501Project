<h1><em>Fahim's Ethical Reflection</em></h1>


    <p>The automotive industry has continuously and rapidly made advances over several decades which have saved countless lives, and in line with these, the significance autonomous vehicle will bring to humanity is undeniable. In America alone, AVs could reduce 90% of traffic fatalities caused by human error and could save more than 29 000 lives per year (Fleetwood, 2017). Whilst AVs have been developed to provide significant advances in the field of traffic safety, it is important that with every new technology, the ethical implications of its use are considered (Martin, Huff, Gotterbarn, & Miller, 1996). This segment will discuss some ethical and social considerations in relation to the continuous development and integration of autonomous vehicles into main stream society. It will also cover my personal reflections and brief recommendations.</p>
    <p>One major field of research in relation to AV and ethical considerations at present is that of moral algorithms, as initially outlined in the Risks section of this project. Because driving in the real world requires the driver to constantly make quick, complex ethical decisions, software programmers and engineers have been working to analyze ‘crash situations’ which are constantly developing with the aim of simulating variations of real-life scenarios. As such, this requires the creation of algorithms that are utilised by AVs when placed in situations of forced choice. This by in large means that each algorithm for each forced choice scenario is shrouded with ethical assumptions. For example, the choice between running over a human being or an animal, or between crashing into a building or a random box for which the contents is unknown (Fleetwood, 2017).  A popular study conducted in 1967 famously known as the ‘trolley problem’ was carried out by philosopher Philippa Foot that posed an ethical dilemma that is still widely considered in research around forced choice. This study required participants to choose between saving the lives of 5 people who are tied to a train track with a train approaching, and pulling a lever to change the train onto a different track with 1 person tied to it (Foot, 1967). A 2016 study investigating AV ethics recruited participants and presented them with multiple hypothetical traffic accident scenarios which involved making forced-choice decisions where they were posed with a similar dilemma to the one created by Foot – however in this instance, they were asked to choose between the death of one or more passenger(s) or the death of one pedestrian (Bonnefon, Shariff, & Shariff, 2016). Results revealed that over three quarters of the participants felt that the most ethical and justifiable choice would be the AV sacrificing its own passengers, only if it resulted in more lives saved overall. Interestingly, when looking at those who would consider buying an AV, consumers were far less likely to opt for an AV that was programmed to sacrifice themselves or their family as the passengers when faced with a forced-choice scenario. The findings of this study reveal that ultimately, individuals want others to purchase vehicles that prioritised saving the most lives, however most would personally opt for a vehicle that prioritises protecting its own passengers. This highlights the complexities and intricacies that programmers are faced with when creating such algorithms and brings to light the issue of what one individual considers to be ethically right may not be the same as another. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, another important factor to consider with the use of AVs is the implications its rise will have on society from a public health perspective. Technologies are often developed with the purpose of easing the difficulties of day-to-day living, However, this aim of doing so has certainly played a significant role in the ever increasing rates in sedentary behaviour leading to a rise in many health issues (Rojas-Rueda, Nieuwenhuijsen, Khreis, & Frumkin, 2020). The introduction of AVs may contribute to this as it has implications on the way people carry out their travel behaviours. For example, it may reduce the rates of people taking public transport, which for many often means having to do some form of physical movement to move between their desired destination. It may also decrease rates of cycling and walking which could further contribute to the sedentary phenomenon we are already seeing. Whilst researchers have found it difficult to make exact predictions around the impact the rise of AVs in mainstream society will have on travel behaviour, a 2019 review of modelling studies suggested that AVs have the potential to inflate the number of vehicle miles travelled per person anywhere between 15 and 59% and as a result, deflate the proportion of individuals that opt for active or public transport (Soteropoulos, Berger, & Ciari, 2019). This in turn also has implications for air quality and general increase in traffic related costs.</p>
    <p>Moreover, there lies the issue of access and equity. Urban areas are more likely to adopt and integrate AV technologies in comparison to their rural counterparts.  According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2019) globally, 55% of the world’s population live in an urban area. This means that 45% of the population will find the potential benefits posed by AV use less accessible. Further, as the market stands at present, those who are more financially affluent are more likely to have access (Fleetwood, 2017). In addition, this may pose a risk for job opportunities for those who work in the driving industry which may displace some individuals from their jobs as their services may become redundant with the use of AVs.</p>
    <em><b>Personal Reflections and Recommendations</b></em>
    <p>Prior to starting this project, I have personally admired AV technology since I have come to know of it as a concept. However, upon reflection, I mainly focused on surface level factors associated with AVs such as physical design and new technological features. This project has given me the chance to look further into the opportunities that have resulted as AV technology develops. Statistics around the reduction in traffic accident incidents have been far more promising than I had anticipated. Further, it has been interesting to look into the choices that are available and how factors such as brand perception play a significant role when it comes to consumers’ decision-making (Eggers & Eggers, 2011) as well as the varying degrees of automation AVs have (as developed by SAE) (Society of Automotive Engineers, 2021). I was not aware prior to this project that the market is currently mostly dominated by level three automation (conditional automation). Researching the choices available brought to the forefront the fact that few technological leaders have developed level four automation, whereas previously I had assumed that the industry as a whole was far closer to achieving level 5 (full automation) than it really is. </p>
    <p>Taking a deeper look at the risks associated with AVs as part of this project has been really enlightening. I was vaguely aware of risk factors such as cyber security, however empirical evidence suggests that AVs still have a long way to go in terms of development of safety features and risk.  Considering that AVs have the potential to foster a false sense of security for drivers when utilising an AV leading to less attention paid, appears to push back on the advantages of utilising an AV in the first place. It seems that this is due to the ethical dilemmas that are posed which largely require human intellect and instinct to figure out. The most interesting part of this project has been the consideration of ethical issues associated with AVs. Whilst there are several possible ethical challenges that are posed with the rise of AVs on the market, the few considered in this project – namely moral algorithms, public health implications on health and accessibility have been particularly thought-provoking for me. </p>
    <p>I have come to realise the importance of looking at technologies more critically rather than solely the advantages they come with. Taking into account the several facets of considerations when thinking about the broader implications of AVs, I believe that large strides still need to be made in AI technology in order to make it a unanimously safer transport option than those already available and controlled by humans. As such, it is promising to see that leaders in AV technology have not yet reached level 5 automation as there are many factors that require fine tuning. It is unclear as to whether moral algorithms will ever reach a point where they can universally calculate the most favourable and desirable outcome for all involved, given this often requires the consideration of other biases that are intrinsically human including emotions, and individual personality traits, values, beliefs and preferences (Fleetwood, 2017). This taken together with the wider environment, socioeconomic (including accessibility and equity) and public health implications it would be fair to  strongly recommend that further research and development in AV technology uses a multidisciplinary approach that actively involves experts across several fields including (but not limited to), programmers, engineers, psychologists, lawyers, public health experts/policy makers. It would also be useful for private manufacturers of AVs to collaborate with public sectors in order to ensure the protection and wellbeing of society is upheld and prioritised alongside the innovation of new AV technologies.  </p>
